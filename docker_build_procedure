Step 1: Clone the repo which contains pox.xml. Both Dockerfile and pom.xml should be in same folder.

Step 2: Build the source code using Dockerfile (We are building manually using mvn clean package)
FROM maven:3.5.2-jdk-8
WORKDIR /var/test
COPY . .
RUN mvn clean package

Step 3: Create Volume Folder (sudo chmod 777 file_name)
> Create a Dockerfile in volume folder and write below lines. 

Step 4:
FROM tomcat
COPY build_file.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps
CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"]

Step 5:
Procedure 1:
Copy WAR files to the Volume folder () and cd .. (to the previous folder where Dockerfile and builds are place)

Build Docker Image - >> docker build -d <imagename:tag_name> .
Run the docker Image to create container - >> docker run -d -p <hostport:containerport> -v volume_folder:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ tomcat:9.0(from Docker Hub)
Docker container will be created after this. To go inside the container - >> docker exec -it <container_id> bash 
# If its running then will run tomcat in the browser using- >> public_id:hostport/projectfolder
#If its not running then check the container status using - >> docker ps -a and debug accordingly

OR

Procedure 2:
Copy WAR files to the Volume folder ()

Build Docker Image - >> docker build -d <imagename:tag_name> .
Run the docker Image to create container - >> docker run -d -p <hostport:containerport> <docker_image:tag_name>
Docker container will be created after this. To go inside the container - >> docker exec -it <container_id> bash 
# If its running then will run tomcat in the browser using- >> public_id:hostport/projectfolder
#If its not running then check the container status using - >> docker ps -a and debug accordingly

--END
